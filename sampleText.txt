Artificial intelligence has captured the popular imagination since Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. Hollywood has trafficked in sci-fi fantasies for the last two decades, portraying scenarios where humans and machines co-exist, either as equals or enemies. It has given us The Terminator, Blade Runner, and Ex Machina. Yet while we watched in horror as man-made machines disposed of their creators as a mere nuisance in Hollywood films, slowly and silently artificial intelligence descended upon humanity— and not in the movies—but in real, everyday life. Here’s a simple, but accurate, explanation of the way current AI works: Give the AI program a picture of a dog and tell it that it’s a picture of a dog. Give it another, but different, picture of a dog, and tell it that it’s a picture of a dog. Do this again with another picture of a dog. Now do this on the factor of a million or a billion times. The algorithm within the AI has now learned the exact characteristics that make up a dog. We can show it pictures and ask it if it’s a picture of a dog, and it will answer accurately 100% of the time. This is the method called Deep Learning and is the way current way AI is produced.
