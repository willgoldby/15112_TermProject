The foundations predate the invention of the modern digital computer concerning the invention of computer science. For a long time, machines were made by humans to make calculations.The first working mechanical calculator was designed and constructed by Wilhelm Schickard. In 1673, the Stepped Reckoner was demonstrated by Gottfried Leibniz. The documentation of the binary system was also done by Leibniz. Many totally consider him to be the very first computer scientist. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry when he released his simplified arithmetic machine. The designing of the Difference Engine in 1822 by Charles Babbage absolutely gave him the idea for the first programmable mechanical calculator, which he called the Analytical Engine.The development of this machine began in 1834, which really helped lead to the adoption of a punched card system that was derived from the Jacquard loom. Programming a myriad of calculations was a feature of the machine. Ada Lovelace wrote an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers in 1843, which is literally considered to be the first computer program. Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical information. Eventually his company became part of IBM.
