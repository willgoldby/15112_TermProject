# 15112 Term Project

## Project name: Prose Style Editor

## How to use
1. Run the GUI2.py file
2. When the GUI appears, click on the top button titled "Load text". Load a .txt file from your computer.
3. Once the .txt is loaded, you can change the text's style by clicking on the other buttons. Each button will make changes to text, either by removing unnecessary words, showing where nominalizations are, changing passive voice to active voice, or shortening long sentences. 

## Necessary libraries
The Prose Style Editor uses the natural language processing library, spaCy, which will need to be pip installed. To use the library, go here: https://spacy.io/usage/
